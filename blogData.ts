    content: `Wedged comfortably in a metal jump seat at the back of the plane, my eyes focused on the exposed wires sprawling across the ceiling like an intricate web. The roaring sounds of the engine were constant and oddly soothing, interrupted by the occasional, uneasy crackling and popping of fuel cans with the ever-changing pressure. I was riding in the cold fuselage of the Iluyshin IL-76, an old Russian cargo plane fit for one mission only; transporting people to Antarctica's interior.

I tried to clear my mind of all of the horrific scenarios that could play out when landing on a desolate blue ice runway in remote Antarctica. I was about to step onto the coldest, windiest and highest continent on the planet. I was about to spend my vacation climbing in the largest desert in the world and the only continent still virgin to war. As the door opened and the bitter cold pierced my left cheek, it was clear that I had ventured north of the wall, into a place that is vast and unknown.

I was in Antarctica in pursuit of climbing the tallest mountain on the continent, Vinson Massif. Standing proud at 16,050ft, Vinson would be my 6th out of the Seven Summits, an adventure achievement comprised of climbing the tallest peak on each of the seven continents. Vinson isn't technical, it's not physically grueling, nor is it tall in comparison to Mt. Everest or even Kilimanjaro, but she still has a way of taking your breath away.

After spending six and a half years working towards achieving the Seven Summits, finally, I got the chance to sit back, relax, and truly enjoy a mountain free of the normal anxieties associated with a large expedition.

This expedition was meant to be straightforward – up, down and off in a little over a week. But we all know what happens to the best laid plans. Every peak teaches you something and Vinson was no different. She taught me more patience, as we would be reminded of Mother Nature's power through three different weather delays, almost tripling the estimated expedition time to 19 days.

With little rest at high camp we woke early to snag a 24hr weather window before another storm was due to hit. The nine-mile slog to the summit was mind numbing at times because when you're playing in a sea of nothingness, it's impossible to not get completely lost in the surreal scene around you.

Marching to a slow rhythmic cadence up the mountain and along the exposed summit ridge, we eventually reached her summit on December 9th, 2017 at 8:20pm. At the top of the bottom of the world, it was hopeless to decipher where the Earth ended and the sky began. I couldn't help but be in awe of the pure, unblemished landscape below untouched by the hand of mankind.

Antarctica stole a piece of my heart, but I take solace in the fact that we will meet again, when I venture to the South Pole.`

    content: `I imagine that I am not alone in admitting that lately I have felt a bit "stuck". Pursuing an unconventional lifestyle that includes raising tens of thousands of dollars to take a stab at completing one of the greatest adventure achievements has come with monumental peaks and forbidden pits.

It feels like I am stuck on a rollercoaster that shoots me high, pulls me low, and swings me round and round, and as much as I want to get off this rollercoaster sometimes, I simply can't…because it's my destiny to ride this ride until the end.

In an attempt to "unstick" myself, I wandered into the woods in search of knowledge and direction. Instead of feeling lost in the infinite pages of my life atlas, I am choosing to answer some heavy questions about myself in an effort to create forward movement once again beginning with the hardest. What defines Kim Hess?

I have struggled most of my life with the unnerving sensation I get when I feel as though everyone is looking at me. I worship my privacy and those who know me well know that I keep my inner most personal thoughts and feelings close to my heart, rarely inviting the world in to experience it.

Conquering the tallest mountain in the world was a deeply personal achievement that quickly threw me head first into the not-so-private life. Sharing this story with strangers was something I loathed simply because the fight of making the journey relatable to anyone seemed impossible.

In the blink of an eye I found that I was no longer known by my given name, Kim, Kimberly, Kimmy…I was referred to as "The Everest Girl". One might assume that this would be the greatest compliment. On the contrary those three words made my skin crawl. I'm not just "The Everest Girl"…that doesn't define me…that's just something I did.

What defines a human being? Is it our career, friends, education level, salary, social media followers, children, accomplishments, marriage, mortgage, a last name? What defines our being? Our purpose? Our legacy?

What defines me today may not define me next week, or in three months, a year, or five years, it is simply what defines me today. I am not "The Everest Girl", or the "Littlest Hess", or "Kim the Crazy Climber". I am a strong, driven, badass dreamer who understands that pain is temporary, playing catch-up will only slow you down, and I am 100% comfortable being UNcomfortable.

What defines you?`

    content: `Today I didn't want to get out bed. Like two positive magnets being forced together, my body clung to the safety of my sheets but my mind impatiently pulled in the opposite direction knowing it was time. It was time to get up and against all odds, I got up, made my bed, and found myself splayed out on the couch under a blanket with my eyes closed.

I had made it a measly 20 steps from my bed and although some might consider this an epic fail, I considered it a small victory. Who knows how long I actually fell back asleep but at some point the roar of my stomach cracked my eyelids open. Get. Up.

I pulled myself up off the couch, threw on some shorts, pulled out my cobweb wrapped running shoes, found a hat and my headphones and trudged out of the house. Against all odds, I was running…in the heat of the day. I haven't been on a run since returning from Everest, roughly 12 months ago, and for whatever reason today felt like the day to give it a shot.

It has been a little over a year since I dragged and clawed my feet onto the roof of the world, Mt. Everest, 29,034ft above the clouds. Watching the 2017 Everest climbing season come and go, I was torn between a deep longing to return to the only place I feel "normal" and the relief of watching the progress of friends from the comfort of my own bed.

What's next? The question we all hate to be asked. Why is it once you achieve something in your life like a promotion, marriage, purchase a home, graduate, have a child etc. that the following question is always, "What's next?" Why do we feel the need to always ask each other about the future instead of focusing on the present?

Life tends to focus on the triumphs and victories, the "summits", yet we rarely acknowledge the letdowns or the setbacks. No one ever asks me how I am today – just what mountain is next?

Well today, and for the last 12 months, I have been dealing with a mysterious chronic hip pain that is a pretty shitty souvenir of what I accomplished in 2016. Every time I sit, stand, walk, jump, run, or laydown I have a constant irritating reminder of the dreams I have been chasing and the toll they have taken on my body.

Today is National Running Day – maybe that's why I felt the undeniable pull of the universe to get out of bed and onto the trails. I only ran 1.68 miles and it took longer than I care to admit and not because I was tired, but because every stride was a battle I had to fight hard for. It wasn't pretty, it was painful, but it was a run, and I couldn't be happier.`

    content: `It didn't take much effort to peel my eyelids open minutes before my alarm went off. My conscious mind was confident that I had never actually allowed myself to drift off into a slumber…the strong cadence of my beating heart made that impossible. I was happy and warm, snuggled up in my downsuit under Paul's outstretched sleeping bag and although I was giddy for my day to begin, I was tense.

Will I see dead people? How hard is this really going to be? I wonder what the world looks like from the top? Will everyone make it? I could have sat there forever asking myself questions I didn't know the answers to. The only question I could answer was, "Will I make it?"…of course you will.

Our departure time was meant to be 9pm but in true alpine fashion my clock read 9:20pm. We were late. Glancing up at the route in front of me, my eyes locked on the lengthy dense line of headlamps. We should have left sooner.

In the early morning, around 1am, the world was calm and sleepy around me. The trail of headlamps ahead dwindled as Mingma and I continued to overtake climbers on the Southeast Ridge. The ridge is mind-blowingly magnificent in its beauty. Gazing to my left, the full moon lit up Nepal and in the distance I could see camps III, II, and even basecamp glowing.

Climbing through a chest deep narrow tunnel of snow I had reached the South Summit. My body halted to a victorious stop as I admired the beauty around me. Quiet and paralyzed in that moment I reflected on how I got to this point. Why do I climb? I don't know, perhaps it's for a moment like this where I can touch and feel the power of Mother Nature, the power of God, and the power of myself.

In that silent moment as I watched the sun crest the horizon and the warmth kissed my cheeks, I cried. Turning my head to the left I smiled as the full moon that once rose on the day I was born was going to sleep in the west and I danced. My dream was no longer a dream because it had become a reality.

Those final steps onto the summit blurred together and time ceased to have meaning. It was 5:04am and I was standing on top of the world at 29,034ft. Mingma quickly handed me the radio. Pure joy radiated from my center as I bellowed loudly, "HESS IS ON THE SUMMIT!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH".

I hugged Mingma tightly and we danced like crazy on the summit that we had all to ourselves. I closed my eyes and smiled in the marginal warmth of the sun. I did it. I found my happy.`

    content: `I woke eagerly before my alarm sounded. Today would be a day filled of places I have only dreamed of. It would be a day occupied by hard work, nervousness, and the unknown. I was excited to see the route, but admittedly, there is nothing worse than simply getting started in the morning. Dragging yourself out of your cozy sleeping bag in the premature morning and into the immobilizing chill of the air is the worst. Reluctantly and eagerly I began to move. I will not be late. It's time to pay the South Col a visit.

With crampons finally on, I was pleasantly greeted by Mingma's smiling face. "Kim, we go?" His simple English was comforting. Nodding my head yes, we left Camp III behind. I reminded myself of yesterday's lessons: Be safe, clip, and enjoy this life you are living.

Falling into the line of people on the route, I fought to find my rhythm. In that fraction of a moment, without thought, my hands mirrored Mingma's and we stretched out to catch him. With impaired reflexes and limited dexterity in the frigid morning, I felt the straps of his backpack in my fingers. As fast as I remember feeling those straps they were gone. He slipped through my grip.

Glancing over my shoulder I saw the red Mountain Hardware suit glissading down the Lhotse face, eventually going airborne over an ice bulge. My head swiveled back to my feet. Standing in one place I was short of breath. My heart felt like it would burst through my chest. I know that backpack. I know that red downsuit. Did my friend just die?

The impossible had transpired. A miracle. He stopped on the only flat area on the Lhotse face, the size of two king beds, which was thick with crevasses. He was alive.

The South Col was uncannily quiet and static, yet strangely, I felt at peace. Gazing up at Her glowing under the twilight of the sun I grinned, and although my butt cheeks were freezing in the wind, I was exactly where I was meant to be.

Closing my eyes I laid there waiting for my alarm to ring, signifying the beginning of what I'm sure would be the greatest adventure of my life.`

    content: `It was a calm morning. The air was crisp, but not too cold. The wind was sleepy. The stars were dampened by the bright light of the almost full moon as camp buzzed with noises of excitement. I laced my boots up nice and tight and made sure my harness was secure. Eating pieces of bacon and gulping down some coffee, it was hard to eat. In a few short minutes I would be departing basecamp for the last time because it was finally time to climb to the top of the world.

I wasn't nervous. I felt eerily calm. This is the moment I've been waiting for. Ready or not, here I come.

The thirty-minute walk up to Crampon Point was effortless this time. My lungs felt full of air and my chest no longer begged to cough. The mood was contagious. Everyone was smiling. Putting my crampons on I laughed to myself. This is going to be f*&king awesome.

Rolling into Camp I four and a half hours after leaving Everest Basecamp was my fastest time yet. The sun was shining and with little to any wind it was hot. I slept like a rock at Camp I.

In the blink of an eye we were gearing up in the dark to attack the Lhotse face once again. I was nervous. The Lhotse face had broken me the last time I paid her a visit and although no one outwardly knew that, I was nervous she would crack me again.

Within a few minutes of beginning our ascent, it was blindingly obvious that this was going to be relatively painless compared to last time. Lungs full of air and a smile on my face the team was moving effortlessly quick and efficient up the mountain.

Tragedy has a way of revealing a message that often times we need to hear or be reminded of. In this tragedy, I was grateful for the important reminder to always be clipped to the rope and the consequences of making a mistake.

Pulling on my boots I crawled out of my tent as the sun was casting a warm haze of color in the distance. I felt at peace gazing up at the summit and I felt gratitude for the beautiful life I had the privilege to be living.`

But then it happened. Word had arrived that a weather window had opened up and we might actually have a shot at the summit. The team was suddenly buzzing with excitement. Red light turned to green light!

I struggled to fall asleep. My mind raced with excitement and questions. What would the summit feel like? Would I make it? Had all my training been enough? Every minute felt like an hour as I waited for my alarm to finally go off.

The climb from Camp IV to the summit would be the most challenging thing I had ever done. But I was ready. Years of training, months of preparation, and weeks of acclimatization had all led to this moment.

As I packed my bag for the final time, I took a deep breath. This was it. The green light was on and there was no turning back now.`

    content: `As a child, I remember going to the zoo on field trips and with the family to learn about all the different animals in the world. As a child, a trip to the zoo is exciting, educational, scary, and mesmerizing at times. As a child, it never occurs to you that perhaps the animals don't enjoy sitting in a cage with hundreds of weird looking animals staring back at them through bars and glass.

Everest basecamp is in a lot of ways like the zoo, except I'm the animal in the cage and the world is watching my every move.

The hissing and buzzing above is as annoying as a mosquito in your tent. Drones. I hate them. Drones flying above our camp that belong to some stranger are enraging. What do they want to film our tents for? It's not like we're over in our little camp having a firework show that no one else is allowed to see!

Helicopters. Oh helicopters. I have a love hate with those machines in the sky. They are our lifeline should things go astray, they bring supplies to basecamp, they help the sick get down and they bring gear up the mountain. What's bothersome is when one of two helipads is practically in your camp. All day long starting as early as 7am helicopters are about to land on my tent.

Finally there are the trekkers. Hundreds (maybe thousands) of people come to Nepal every year in search of their "summit". They pilgrimage the same path I did in hopes of achieving a dream or a check next to a bucket list item.

Who am I to sit here and be irritated by their success? Perhaps it's because I'm envious that they have reached their summit and I'm still pacing in my cage waiting for mine.

To each and every Trekker who has reached their high-point, congratulations! To those of us who continue to wait for ours, find patience to endure the cabin fever, you will touch the sky soon enough.`

Rotation 3 had begun and the team was excited to finally be pushing toward Camp 3 at 24,600ft on the Lhotse face. For me personally, I was skeptical about today. I was suffering from a severe case of bronchitis that had taken a toll on my body. Every breath I took was followed by a violent coughing fit. Sleep was impossible because every time I began to doze off, a cough would wake me.

The Lhotse face is a 3,000ft wall of ice that connects Camp 2 to Camp 3. It's steep, exposed, and unforgiving. I knew this rotation would be the hardest thing I had ever done in my current condition.

Step by step I made my way up the fixed lines. Every breath burned and every cough sent shockwaves through my body. I wanted to quit. I wanted to turn around. But I knew that if I did, my dream would be over.

Hours passed like days. The sun beat down mercilessly and the heat was suffocating. My pace slowed to a crawl. I began to doubt myself. Why am I doing this? Is this worth it?

And then, through the suffering and the pain, I reached Camp 3. I collapsed into my tent, gasping for air. I had made it. Barely. But I had made it.

In that moment, lying there exhausted and broken, I found peace. Sometimes we have to suffer to appreciate the beauty that awaits us.`

Snapping photos as we headed up the Western Cwm I noticed a jacket sprawled out to my left. Frozen in the position as though it was worn by someone relaxing in a recliner, the jacket was covered in ice.

These images of frozen artifacts are scattered throughout the route and are constant reminders of what has taken place on this mountain. Ice axes, old fixed rope, tents, oxygen bottles, bodies, and clothing are just a few of the many findings on Everest.

Looking at these artifacts I can't help but wonder about the history. Who owned this jacket? What year did they climb? Did they make it? Are they alive? Everest is a museum unlike any other in the world.

Continuing up to Camp 2 I found myself climbing behind a group of Sherpas carrying loads. Their pace was surprisingly fast for the amount of weight they had on their backs. I was barely keeping up and I didn't have anything on my back.

Settling into Camp 2 I took a moment to appreciate where I was. At 21,300ft, the views were stunning. The ice fall sparkled below and the summit loomed above. I was one step closer to my dream.

Looking around at the frozen relics of expeditions past, I was reminded that this mountain has seen it all. Triumph and tragedy. Joy and sorrow. And here I was, just another climber adding my story to the mountain's history.`

Everest is much like that, it intimidates and scares me every minute I think about it, yet I can't seem to get enough. It only seems natural that as I make my way to the Holy Grail herself, Everest, another fear of mine would literally walk into my sleeping bag.

A little over a week into our trek, I made myself comfortable in my spacious room in the town of Periche. Nestling up in my -40 degree sleeping bag on top of a cot with a thin mattress, I was snug as a bug playing Candy Crush while waiting for my Benadryl to kick in.

I started to feel my eyes getting heavy when I felt something plummet down my back. My initial thought was, "Your headlamp just slipped off your side - go to bed." I closed my eyes and began to doze off again…until I felt "something" scamper up my back.

I lurched out of bed petrified of what I was certain was a colossal tarantula crawling up my body only to realize I was still zipped tight in my sleeping bag. SMACK. Face plant on the floor and electronics airborne.

After much scrambling, a mouse came sprinting out from under my pillow. Great. It's going to be in my bags that are wide open with all of my gear out.

The only thing worse than waking up to a mouse in your sleeping bag is not knowing whether or not the mouse was still in your room.

One might think waking up to a mouse in their sleeping bag isn't that big of a deal, and they are probably right. For me, it was one of the most terrifying things to encounter in the dark. The important lesson here is that I wasn't a sissy and I took control of the situation I was tossed into and came out victoriously. That mouse had no chance of scaring me out of my bed, much like Mt. Everest has no chance of scaring me away from the summit.`

Remember to be patient. Not everything will go according to plan. Weather will change. People will frustrate you. Your body will hurt. But through it all, remember why you started this journey.

Remember to forgive. Forgive others for their shortcomings. Forgive yourself for yours. Holding onto anger and resentment will only weigh you down on the mountain.

Remember to be mindful. Take in every moment. The beautiful and the ugly. The highs and the lows. This experience will change you, but only if you let it.

Remember that the journey is more important than the destination. The summit is just a bonus. The real victory is in every step you take, every breath you breathe, every challenge you overcome.

Remember to be grateful. Grateful for your health. Grateful for your support system. Grateful for this opportunity that so few people ever get.

Remember that you are stronger than you think. You have trained for this. You have sacrificed for this. You are ready.

And finally, remember to have fun. This is your dream. Enjoy it.

After the earthquake, we made our way through the destruction to Kathmandu. The city I had fallen in love with just weeks earlier was now unrecognizable. Buildings had collapsed. Ancient temples had crumbled. The streets were filled with debris and despair.

Saying goodbye to my teammates was harder than I expected. We had been through something together that few people will ever understand. We had stared death in the face and somehow survived. That bonds people in ways that are difficult to explain.

I needed to heal. Not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. So I went to Thailand. I ran on the beach as storms rolled in. I swam in the ocean as lightning cracked across the sky. I pushed my body to its limits, trying to outrun the trauma that haunted me.

Running through lightning became my metaphor for healing. Sometimes you have to charge headfirst into the storm to find the calm on the other side. Sometimes you have to embrace the chaos to find peace.

The earthquake took my dream from me that year. But it gave me something more valuable - perspective. Life is short. Dreams are important. But the people we love and the moments we share are what truly matter.`

    content: `Difficult doesn't even begin to describe the trek out from Everest basecamp, not because it was physically demanding, but because my spirit was broken. My mind screamed, GET ME OUT OF HERE! Every cell in my body wanted to escape the devastation all around me, but another part of me, my essence, wanted to stay.

I had come to Nepal with a goal to conquer a mountain and achieve a lifelong dream. With the mountain unattainable I turned my eyes to a nation in ruins. The Nepalese people shared their country, culture, and their beloved mountains with me and more importantly they supported my dream. It was time to reciprocate the love and support they had shown me. It was time to get to work.

Our two-week trek out of the Khumbu Valley and back to Kathmandu began, and we did our best to keep morale high. Laughter and smiles eventually seized everyone like a pandemic, but the reality would return swiftly and painfully as we passed through village after village and saw the destruction from the earthquake.

In a small village called Phortse, I found something unexpected - a yoga practice that would help heal my broken spirit. The instructor, a local woman who had lost her home in the earthquake, taught with a grace and peace that seemed impossible given the circumstances.

Following the yellow dirt road home, I realized that this journey wasn't over. It was just beginning. The earthquake had taken my summit dreams, but it had given me something more valuable - a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper connection to the Nepalese people.`

    content: `Walking out from basecamp after the earthquake was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Not because of the physical challenge, but because of the emotional weight I carried with every step.

As I made my way down the valley, my phone began to buzz with messages. Thousands of them. Friends, family, strangers - all reaching out to make sure I was okay. All offering their love and support.

But here's the thing - I didn't need to be rescued. Not in the way they thought, anyway.

Yes, the earthquake was terrifying. Yes, I witnessed things that will haunt me forever. Yes, my dream was ripped away from me in a matter of seconds.

But I was alive. I was breathing. I was putting one foot in front of the other.

The messages kept coming. "Are you safe?" "Do you need help?" "We're praying for you." And while I appreciated every single one of them, I realized something important - the person who needed rescuing wasn't me.

It was the Nepalese people. The ones who lost their homes. Their families. Their livelihoods. They were the ones who needed help. They were the ones who needed our prayers.

I walked out of that valley a different person. I didn't need to be rescued, but I needed to be reminded of what truly matters in life. Namaste, Nepal. I'll be back.`

    content: `Today was my last day at Everest basecamp. The expedition was officially over. Not because we had summited, but because Mother Nature had other plans.

Walking through the devastation one last time, I tried to memorize every detail. The prayer flags that still fluttered in the wind. The rocks that had been painted with messages of hope. The Sherpa who still smiled despite losing everything.

Our last dinner together was bittersweet. We laughed about the good times. We cried about the bad. We made promises to stay in touch, knowing that some of us never would.

It's over. Those two words felt so final. So complete. Yet so incomplete at the same time.

I had spent years training for this moment. Years saving money. Years dreaming about standing on top of the world. And now it was over, without ever reaching the summit.

But as I sat there, surrounded by my teammates, I realized something important. It's not over. It's never over. Dreams don't die just because they don't come true when we want them to.

I'll be back. That much I know for certain. The mountain will be waiting. And so will I.`

    content: `I have been overwhelmed with the feeling of being cheated out of a dream. I was cheated of the dream I worked so hard to achieve and the dream I chased down when everyone said I couldn't do it. I was climbing Mt. Everest. I could taste the summit but then the world started shaking and in the course of a few minutes my dream slipped through my hands.

April 25, 2015 at 12pm the glacier beneath my tent rumbled, violently shaking. I could hear avalanches kicking off all around us. I should have been scared standing in the snow barefoot in my long johns, but with no visual and being unaware of my surroundings from the falling snow and low clouds, I started laughing. Which avalanche would hit us first?

Camp 2 sits in a fishbowl: the west shoulder of Mt. Everest on one side, Lhotse to another, and Nuptse finishing it off. We were sitting in the middle of a ticking time bomb comprised of thousands of feet of ice and rock towering over us ready to cause destruction at any moment.

No one was seriously injured of the 70+ living at Camp 2 that day. How is that possible? Although I was not physically harmed, my spirit was shattered. Emotions fluttered. I felt helpless, angry, sad, vulnerable, dispirited, and thankful…I felt alive.

The sun shined optimistically on my face the next morning. My dream was over and I knew it, but I also knew I was given a gift, the gift of a second chance. I was given a chance to come home and appreciate everything, everyone, and everyday.

Perhaps this trip had more in store for me than I originally prepared for, but what? Time will tell, but I now know, it was never about the summit.`

    content: `There are certain events in our lives that change us. Events that you can never erase from your memory. Events that make you a different person. I'll never forget the first time I rode a bike without training wheels, or when I lost my grandparents, or when I walked across the stage to receive my undergraduate degree.

There is one event in my life that until now, I struggled to see what the Universe's purpose was in throwing it my way. I broke my arm. That sounds silly yes, but I really, really broke my arm.

Summiting Denali last June has been one of my greatest accomplishments thus far. It tested me in every way possible, but the moment I stood on that summit – I was invincible. I could do anything. Nothing could stop me. I should have known better.

The following day, my team and I began our descent down the mountain and back home. The clouds moved in for the first time the entire trip and I found myself slowly moving down the fixed lines. Then I heard it. Bones crushing in my wrist.

I had severely displaced intraarticular fractures of the distal radius and ulna and a fractured 4th metacarpal in my hand. I had emergency reconstructive surgery that lasted six hours and wouldn't be the last.

I spent months in the dark, falling further and further away from my dreams and reality. I had fear. I felt sorry for myself. I was too proud to ask for help. Why me?

How does one crawl out of a hole they find themselves in? What does it take? A DREAM. A dream woke me up. Courage woke me up.

I'm finally awake and living. My childhood dream is coming true next March and I'm climbing Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. Despite what everyone said, I'm back. I'm living. I'm stronger. I'm better. Welcome.`
